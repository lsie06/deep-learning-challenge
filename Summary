In summary the deep learning model was around 73% accurate when predicting the classification problem. 
When using a model with greater correlation between input and output would likely result in higher prediction accuracy. 
This could be achieved by doing additional data cleanup up front, as well as by using a model with different activation functions and iterating until higher accuracy is reached.
